# Steam-Discovery-Queue-Control
A prototype for a control panel for Steam Discovery Queue, giving users granular control over games recommended by Steam.

Head to the [local version of the Steam Discovery Queue page](https://korgano.github.io/Steam-Discovery-Queue-Control/steam-disc2.html "Steam Discovery Queue - Local Copy"), then press the "Customize Your Queue" button to reach the control panel.

From there, take a look at the options and play around!
